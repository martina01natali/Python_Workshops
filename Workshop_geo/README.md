# README for Workshop_geo

This is the repository for a Python workshop aimed at students/researchers in geoscience.

Workshop details:
- level: beginner
- supported platforms: windows, linux
- coding framework: jupyter lab, jupyter notebooks, python files, bash executables (for linux users)
- topics: syntax, data cleaning, data analysis, i/o of relevant file types (netCDF4, tif, json, excel), plot
- estimated execution time: 3 h


## Workshop outline

**who_why_how**
- who I am, and my experience with python and coding
- why is python special
- why you should always use AI to learn better and faster: prompt engineering
- how to recognize official documentation and the best resources for debugging
- terminology: executable, script, notebook, debugging, troubleshooting
- survey: students' background, languages known, AI usage, usual tasks

**00_installation_instructions**
- [windows] installing anaconda + create environment + installing packages
- [linux] executing script
- look for packages on conda channels

**01_basics**
- syntax: indentation, no variable type definition, "everything is an object"
- built-in types and mutable/non-mutable: str, list, dict, numerical types, sets 
- comprehensions: lists and dicts
- statements: conditionals, loops, while
- functions' definition, default sets, type hinting, args and kwargs (very brief)

**02_data_analysis**
- read an excel file with pandas
- data cleaning and timeseries resampling/grouping
- plot: scatterplot, timeseries, histogram
- subplots and multiple plots

**03_io_geo**
- read/write tifs with xarray
- reproject, get nearest neighbor
- plot with cartopy
- read geojsons with geojson and json
- read/write netCDF4 files with netCDF4

**04_modules**
- write functions in external file and call from notebook

**additional_resources**
- a notebook of my own to explore
- my github repositories
- ARSET classes
- a full page of links
