# Additional resources

## Python books and online guides, open
Python for Data Analysis:
	https://wesmckinney.com/book/
Python Data Science Handbook (my reccomendation for absolute beginners, but becomes quickly too simple), this versioni is in full jupyter notebooks...I don't know what more you could ask for...
	https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook
Repository with many books:
	https://github.com/lpvcpp/learn_python/tree/master
Introduction to Python in Earth Science Data Analysis (free for CNR people):
	https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-78055-5
Object-oriented programming in python:
	https://python-textbok.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/index.html
CINECA python course:
	https://eventi.cineca.it/en/hpc/introduction-python-programming


My personal notes, from when I first started:
	https://github.com/martina01natali/OOPROJECT/tree/main
There's also my python project (`projmodule`) which is a good starting point for the intermidiate level and comes as a package (i.e. a library) that you can install:
	https://github.com/martina01natali/OOPROJECT/tree/main/pyproj
And remember to follow me on GitHub :)

### A list of resources from AI-powered search
Here's a curated list of sites and resources to learn Python for geosciences:

1. Geo-Python: A comprehensive online course covering the basics of Python programming for geosciences. It includes interactive lectures and weekly exercises[2].

2. Project Pythia: An education and training hub for the geoscientific Python community. It offers several resources, including:

   - The Foundations Book: A comprehensive set of tutorials covering foundational Python skills for geosciences
   - Pythia Cookbooks: Collections of advanced and domain-specific example workflows
   - Resource Gallery: A curated list of educational resources for learning Python in geosciences
   - Webinar Tutorial Series: Regular instructor-led interactive tutorials[3]

3. Python Resources for Earth Sciences: A GitHub repository containing a curated list of open-source Python libraries relevant to Earth Sciences, including hydrology, meteorology, geospatial analysis, climatology, and more[1][4].

4. EarthPy: A Python package for plotting and working with spatial raster and vector data, specifically designed for earth science applications.

5. PyGMT: A Python interface for the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT), allowing geoscientists to create publication-quality maps and figures.

6. Pangeo: A community platform for Big Data geoscience, offering tutorials and resources for using Python in large-scale earth science applications.

7. SciPy Lectures: While not specifically for geosciences, these lectures cover scientific computing with Python and are relevant for geoscientists.

8. GeoPython Conference: An annual conference focused on Python in the geospatial field. Their website often includes presentation materials and tutorials.

9. EarthDataScience.org: Offers tutorials and courses on using Python for earth data science, including working with satellite imagery and geospatial data.

10. Software Carpentry: Provides workshops and lessons on basic lab skills for research computing, including Python programming that can be applied to geosciences.

These resources cover a wide range of topics and skill levels, from beginner to advanced, and focus on applying Python to various geoscience disciplines[1][2][3][4]. They offer a mix of tutorials, courses, libraries, and practical examples to help geoscientists leverage Python in their work.
